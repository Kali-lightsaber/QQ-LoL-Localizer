Legacy Notes - DO NOT USE
===
It seems like Tencent took active steps to prevent users from using this app and it is not only no longer working but also puts a risk on the user as they may decide to block accounts. As a result I decided to remove existing packaged executables but to leave the source code if anybody felt adventurous in trying to find a new way to make it work at their on risk.


Differences when playing in China (most likely outdated)
====

The players
===

Chinese players talk less and whine less, so should you. Complaining and raging is not a thing to do here.
Players do not say their lane all the time and it should be implicit depending on the picked heroes.

The heroes
===

* Updates aren't made at the same time, expect some delay between an update on the EU or US server and the same update on the Chinese server (usually a couple of weeks at least).
* The prices of some heroes are different, but most of them remains identical.
* The free Champions Rotation happens every Friday at 10 AM UTC+08:00

The bonus
===

*This is the old bonus system, check below for latest info*

~~After level 5, 10, 15 and 20 you are eligible to some bonus (XP/IP Boost, runes...), to claim those bonus you have to go on http://lol.qq.com/act/a20110418gifts/ and click on the matching level.
You will be asked to log-in and select your server.~~

**2016-03-04**: Updates I received from a user (`Crushie`):
```
The bonus system has been reworked, and is currently 3 bonuses that update after completion or midnight.

2 of the bonusses are related to gameplay:
Get 60 minion kills in a single fight / Play 2 different heroes today / get 3 kills or assist in a single game.. stuff like that, 
these are updated at midnight.
The bonuses here can be a champion rent / 50, 100 or 150 IP / runes and 4 win exp or ip boost.

Whereas the last bonus is related to level, level 1-10 has a bonus for each level, giving 14 days of "rent" on a hero,
i think they are the same heroes for each account, but i can't remember the order of them
(lower level is littered with the same heroes, which are too expensive to buy and are not on the free rotation)
Level 8 and 11 gave tier 2 runes for ad and spellcaster, giving plenty enough to easily fill your runepage until level 17'ish.
```
