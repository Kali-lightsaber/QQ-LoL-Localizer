QQ League of Legends (LoL) Localizer
=====

This project started soon after I found ways to translate most of the Chinese League of Legends client manually, and realized that each update would reset those changes: Why not do a tool to do it for me? I then shared the tool with a few of my friends and finally decided to share it openly.

The latest version can be downloaded in the release section:

https://github.com/thomas-barthelemy/QQ-LoL-Localizer/releases

What Does it do?
====
The Localizer intends to provide an easy tool to modify the Chinese League of Legends client (from lol.qq.com) in order to localize and translate it in English.

App details
====

Tools format
===

* The regular package: no installation, easy to move.
* *Discontinued*: The ClickOnce package, auto-installer, easy to update.

What this tool can achieve:
===

* The Air client localized in English (Play menus, runes, summoner's spells...)
* In game localization in English (Items, texts) while still supporting Chinese characters (Player's name, chat...)
* Check if any of the file necessary for this translation was change and re-apply the fix. (Deals with updates)

What you won't have:
===

* Sounds in English: The audio bank file for the English language isn't complete.
* TCLS Launcher in English: This Air launcher is made separately by the QQ team and localization is not yet supported.

In a nutshell, if you tried playing League of Legends in China, this translate tool might save you a lot of trouble!

How to use the software
====

1. Launch the TCLS client to be sure your version is up-to-date.
2. Open the QQ LoL Localizer.
3. If it's the first time you use it, you will have to define where is located your "TCLS\Client.exe".
4. You should have a view of all files that need to be modified and there current state. A file marked as "Fixed" doesn't require any operation, else it needs to be fixed. To fix you can either select the file(s) you want and click on "Fix Selected" or just click on "Fix All".
5. After an update, you might need to re-fix some of the files.

Differences when playing in China
====

The players
===

Chinese players talk less and whine less, so should you. Complaining and raging is not a thing to do here.
Players do not say their lane all the time and it should be implicit depending on the picked heroes.

The heroes
===

* Updates aren't made at the same time, expect some delay between an update on the EU or US server and the same update on the Chinese server (usually a couple of weeks at least).
* The prices of some heroes are different, but most of them remains identical.
* The free Champions Rotation happens every Friday at 10 AM UTC+08:00

The bonus
===

*This is the old bonus system, check below for latest info*

~~After level 5, 10, 15 and 20 you are eligible to some bonus (XP/IP Boost, runes...), to claim those bonus you have to go on http://lol.qq.com/act/a20110418gifts/ and click on the matching level.
You will be asked to log-in and select your server.~~

**2016-03-04**: Updates I received from a user (`Crushie`):
```
The bonus system has been reworked, and is currently 3 bonuses that update after completion or midnight.

2 of the bonusses are related to gameplay:
Get 60 minion kills in a single fight / Play 2 different heroes today / get 3 kills or assist in a single game.. stuff like that, 
these are updated at midnight.
The bonuses here can be a champion rent / 50, 100 or 150 IP / runes and 4 win exp or ip boost.

Whereas the last bonus is related to level, level 1-10 has a bonus for each level, giving 14 days of "rent" on a hero,
i think they are the same heroes for each account, but i can't remember the order of them
(lower level is littered with the same heroes, which are too expensive to buy and are not on the free rotation)
Level 8 and 11 gave tier 2 runes for ad and spellcaster, giving plenty enough to easily fill your runepage until level 17'ish.
```
